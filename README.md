## Dice Game

> Each player can choose to roll the dice or pass the his turn. Once a player pass his turn he cannot roll the dice any more. If all players choose PASS their own turn, then this round is over and will pick up a winner. The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the other players, but without exceeding a target number (for example 31).
